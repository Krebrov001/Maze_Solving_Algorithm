# Maze_Solving_Algorithm
This is a brute-force algorithm that I created which solves mazes. It prints output as ASCII art.
This project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio.

This project is still work in progress. The code for the old Game class needs to be cleaned up, properly formatted, refactored a bit, and throughly tested. I need to finishing partitioning it into .h and .cpp files. Additionally the documentation needs to be written. Please come back later when this project will be in a presentable state.
